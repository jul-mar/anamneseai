# PRD: Configurable Model Selection (Including Gemini 2.5)

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This feature will allow developers to easily change the language model used by the application (e.g., to Gemini 2.5 or other supported models) via a configuration file or environment variable. The goal is to make it simple to switch between different models for development, testing, or deployment purposes, without requiring code changes.

## 2. Goals

- Enable developers to select from multiple supported models (including Gemini 2.5) via configuration.
- Ensure the selected model is used for all LLM interactions in the app.
- Make it easy to add or change models in the future.

## 3. User Stories

- As a developer, I want to specify the model (e.g., Gemini 2.5) in a config file so that I can test different LLMs without changing code.
- As a developer, I want to restart the app and have it use the new model I configured.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. The system must allow specifying the LLM model (e.g., Gemini 2.5, gemma3, etc.) via a configuration file (e.g., `config.json`, `.env`, or similar).
2. The application must read the model selection at startup and use it for all LLM API calls.
3. The system must support at least Gemini 2.5 and the current default model.
4. The configuration method must be documented for developers.
5. If the specified model is unavailable or misconfigured, the system must log an error and fall back to a default model.
6. It must be possible to add new models to the list of supported models by editing the configuration.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- No UI for model selection (no dropdowns or runtime switching).
- No per-user or per-session model selection.
- No automatic detection of available models from remote APIs.
- No authentication or API key management for Gemini 2.5 (assume credentials are handled elsewhere).

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)

- The current model name should be displayed in the developer console/logs at startup.
- The configuration should be as simple as possible (e.g., a single line in `.env` or a key in `config.json`).

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)

- The code should be structured to make it easy to add new models in the future.
- If using environment variables, document the variable name (e.g., `LLM_MODEL_NAME`).
- If using a config file, provide a sample file with comments.

## 8. Success Metrics

- Developers can change the model by editing a config file or environment variable and restarting the app.
- The app uses the selected model for all LLM requests.
- If the model is unavailable, the app logs a clear error and uses the default model.

## 9. Open Questions

- Should the config support specifying model-specific parameters (e.g., temperature, max tokens)?
- Should the config support specifying the LLM API endpoint as well as the model name?
