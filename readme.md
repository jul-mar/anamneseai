QuestionnAIre

# What is it?
A Chatbot you can give a number of questions and it will ask these questions the patient, while verifying the questions and rephrasing them if the patient isnt answering them correctly.


# What is it for?
Patients often wait a lot of time in the waiting room in hospitals or privat practices. At the same time doctors dont have enough time for doing a thorough patient history. The patient could use the time waiting talking to an AI Chat bot which gives the doctor a summary of the most important facts before he sees the patient.
